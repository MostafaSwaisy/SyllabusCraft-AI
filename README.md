# SyllabusCraft-AI
An AI-powered platform that transforms raw technical documentation, textbooks, or learning objectives into a structured, 12-week educational roadmap. It specifically targets Laravel and Full-Stack development, ensuring that every generated syllabus includes practical design patterns and modern software architecture.

## Core Functional Modules:
1. Knowledge Extraction EngineInput: Users upload PDFs, CSVs of curriculum standards, or links to GitHub repositories.
  Process: Uses Python and LLMs to parse complex technical concepts and identify core competencies.
  Output: A structured JSON map of topics ranging from MVC architecture to database design.
2. AI-Driven Curriculum ArchitectContextual Logic:
    Integrates your research on Software Design Patterns to automatically insert lessons on Repositories, Services, and Singletons where they fit best.
     Bilingual Support: Automatically generates all materials in both Arabic and English, ensuring culturally sensitive and accessible content for Palestinian and international contexts.
3. The "Lab Builder" (Laravel Integration)Practical :
  Examples: Generates 50+ practical coding examples and "starter kits" for students.
  Automated Evaluation: Uses n8n workflows to create automated Git repositories for each student, pre-loaded with the generated curriculum.
### Technical ArchitectureBackend: Laravel 11 to manage role-based access for faculty and students. 
1. AI Orchestration: A Python-based FastAPI microservice handling the Code LLM interactions and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
2. Database: MySQL for storing hierarchical syllabus data and student progress metrics.
3. UI/UX: A modern glassmorphism dashboard featuring real-time visualization of the learning curve reduction.
### Strategic Skill AlignmentFeatureYour Background Applied. 
1. New Skill GainedDocument ParsingExperience with CSV analysis, Advanced RAG pipelines & Vector DBsSyllabus LogicExperience teaching 100+ students.
2. Prompt Engineering for Education.
3. Arabic Support. Experience with Arabic text rendering, Multilingual AI deploymentScalabilityHandling 500+ users.
4. Microservices architectureSuccess MetricsLearning Curve Reduction: Aim to reduce student onboarding time by 50%, matching your previous success with Git tutorials.
5. Processing Speed: Ability to generate a full 12-week curriculum from a 200-page PDF in under 10 seconds.
6. Accuracy: Achieve a 90% problem resolution rate for AI-generated coding labs
